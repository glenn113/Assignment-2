<p>GROUP</p>

<b><i>Personal Information</i></b>

Jesse Mesiti, s3728420. Has a background in maths and science, as well as sport and i.t. All of these are from leisure time activities and subjects studied in school. Hobbies varied including anything from health and fitness (gym), to sports (mostly soccer and football) and to computers. Interest in I.T is aimed towards robots and computers once again, in how they work and how they are put together. I.T experience is found exclusively in years studying the subject, and leisure time activities - in this case it was the building of a computer in 2015, except for that not much however.

<i>Matthew Scully (s3722193)</i>

Unlike many other people I have come across, my cultural background is somewhat... vanilla. Both my parents and grandparents, even my great-grandparents were all born and raised in Australia. As far as I know, I have loose ancestral connections to some European countries. These include Sweden, Ireland, England and possibly others which apparently my great, great, great, great...? grandparents came from. I found this quite interesting and surprising when I found out this information because I didn't know of my background up until learning this. A major hobby I enjoy in my spare time is PC computer gaming. I have had some overly fun experiences while playing vast genres of online multiplayer games with friends. I have grown up with PC games since my pre-teens and used it as a great way to cure my boredom. My education to date is I have completed up to Year 12. The high school I went to was Westbourne Grammar School located out Hoppers Crossing way.

Glenn Roberts-I’m Glenn Roberts my student number is 3721547 and email s3721547@student.rmit.edu.au and I am from Melbourne. I believe in a balanced lifestyle. I play videogames and watch TV shows but I also try to exercise when I can whether that be going to the gym or running around the block. I also believe in the saying “healthy body healthy mind” in addition I also watch what I eat to try and live a healthy lifestyle. My fun fact is that I am a black belt in taekwondo, not many people expect that.

<b><i>Team Profile</i></b>

<i>Jesse</i> 
<p>http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=6&V=8&T=6</p>
<p>The above personality test identified myself as a visual learner, a learner that does just this best when reading or seeing pictures. It is much easier for someone such as myself to understand and remember things by sight. I can picture what I am  learning in your head, and learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning and when reciting information will often use these visuals to help.

Visual learners are usually neat and clean, although often may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. Visual learners in generally are attracted to color and spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery both metaphorically and literally.</p>

<p>https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality</p>
<p>The 16 personalities quiz indentified me with the debater personality type. A debater engages in (mostly) formal discussion on a particular matter , in which opposing arguments are put forward. Debaters generally enjoy being correct and disproving their oppositions arguments or opinions, they don’t do this because they are trying to achieve some deeper purpose or strategic goal, but for the simple reason that it’s fun (and often ego enducing). No one loves the process of mental sparring more than debaters, as it gives them a chance to exercise their effortlessly quick wit, broad accumulated knowledge base, and capacity for connecting disparate ideas to prove their points.
	
The main goal of the debater personality type is to gain knowledge, and there is no better way to do this then analysing arguments both your own and someone elses.

<i>Matthew</i>

<b>Myer Briggs Test</b>

According to the Myer Briggs Test, I have the personality of a "Protagonist." The results describe me as a natural born leader, full of passion and charisma. Only around 2% of the population fall under this category and turn out to be characters like politicians, teachers and coaches.

<b>My Learning Style</b>

Auditory: 45% Visual: 35% Tactile: 20%
According to the learning style test, I am mainly an auditory learner, meaning I learn by hearing/listening. I store information by the way it sounds and I remember things by the way I heard them. I have an easier time understanding spoken instructions rather than written ones.

<b>The Big Five Personality Test</b>

This test has five major categories.
For "Openness" I scored 69% (high range) which tends to mean I am creative, adventurous and intellectual.
For "Conscientiousness" I scored 42% (low range) which tends to mean I am impulsive and easily side-tracked.
For "Extraversion" I scored 85% (high range) which tends to mean I am friendly and outgoing.
For "Agreeableness" I scored 62.5% (moderate range) which tends to mean I balance the interests of myself and others similarly.
For "Neuroticism" I scored 42% (low range) which tends to mean I am less likely to experience negative emotions and I am more optimistic and carefree.

Glenn Roberts

Myers-Briggs test
ISTJ - The Duty Fulfiller

the test s show that I am more or a doer/follower rather than a leader in a group environment. This is true in most cases because I am very responsible and I know that the leader of the group is putting responsibility on me to complete the task. However, if I need to be a leader then I can step up to the plate when I need to and i am very adative to the enviroment.

Learining style quiz-Visual
If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.
As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.




<b><i>Ideal Jobs</i></b>

<i>Compare/Contrast Ideal Jobs</i>

A common comparison between the group’s ideal jobs is that three out of the four members wanted to do something that involved programming in general. Both Matthew and Glenn’s jobs required similar skills in the IT field with a knowledge in programming (specifically Java) being sought after. While on the surface, most of the group appeared to have similar functioning jobs, an obvious difference is that Jesse is not seeking a job precisely within the IT industry. With the ideal job of aerospace engineer being listed, Jesse would be working on automated aircraft meaning he would be working in the expanding industry of IT in aviation rather than in the current standard industry that the other members chose as their ideal. Lin would also be taking on the role more of a leader / planner rather than a programmer or developer. When compared to Matthew and Glenn’s job, Lin would still need to have grasped the knowledge of programming, while being able to take charge as an IT director and plan out projects through good use of communication. Glenn stated that he would ideally like to be a data analyst (or scientist) meaning that he would be closely looking at statistics and through his skills in business and mathematics, as well as informatics, be able to construct graphs out of data set. Finally, Matthew would like to take on a programming / developer side of work which means that he would be closely working with someone like Lin (IT director) to achieve a solution for a company. Whether it be an application or website… etc, Matthew would need to have skills in programming and web design to work in his ideal career. Overall, each of the members have chosen quite different paths or fields in the IT industry to work in. While it appears that Matthew and Lin would have more in common than the other members, their jobs still contain different aspects to them and therefore each member has chosen a unique career path in the IT industry for them. 

<b>Industry Data</b>
<b>1.</b>

<i>Jesse – Aerospace engineer</i>
<p>Aerospace engineer, whilst not a job in i.t was not found to be as in demand as civil or construction counterparts when researched, however with Australia’s ambitions to up their military arsenal within the next few years it will definitely be an important occupation. Additionally, not many people will choose to specialise in Aerospace engineering and even fewer will go down the military aspect of it, creating a moderate demand for people specialising within it.</p>
<i>Matthew – Java developer</i>
<p>Java developers, according to the March 2018 Burning Glass statistics is the 7th entry on the Top IT jobs title list, at 713. Java is undoubtably one of the more popular coding languages that is used in a great number of corporations all around the world, because of this Java developers will always be in demand in a great many companies and countries both emerging and established. Whilst many people will go into Java programming it is unlikely to be a problem due to the sheer number of jobs demanding a java programmer.</p>
<i>Lin – I.T Director</i>
<p>Although I.T Director did not appear on the list, it can encompass a great deal of jobs within the director field, such as Service Delivery Manager which was ranked 18th with 338. As such I would think it to be one of the more in demand occupations as leadership is a rare trait in a sense, according to many studies people can learn traits pertaining leadership but the greatest leaders are often born on top of the pedestal so to speak. Director positions are  one of the most important for both an established or emerging corporation as without a chain of command headed by a confident and concise leader, the efficiency of work is severely reduced.</p>
<i>Glenn – IT data analyst/scientist</i>
<p>Data analyst fell under a range of titles within the March 2018 burning glass statistics and as such took up a range of positions on the list, Service Desk Analyst was ranked the highest being 5th on the list with 779 whilst Senior test analysis was ranked the lowest on the list with 275. Data analytics will always be in demand as corporations are always looking to improve their performance and the best way to do this is to examine statistics and data, all companies will be interested in data analytics as a result and will seek out an analyst to translate the quantifiyable statistics into quantative words as this is a niche skill that only a handful of people have a passion for.

<b>2.</b>	
	
<i>Aerospace Engineer</i>
<p>General Skills – Skills in analysis and problem solving as well as creative thinking and a keen attention to detail. Communication skills both verbal and written and project and time management skills. Aerospace Engineering is a particulary sensitive field and this is where skills such as analysis and attention to detail come into play, also solutions may not present themselves at first and as such problem solving and creative skills are often a necessity to overcome this obstacle. Time and project management are also important due to the sheer responsibility of the job. </p>
<p>Aerospace Skills – A keen understanding in mathematics and physics principals as well as an understanding of aerodynamics.
I.T Skills – Although not an I.T job, an understanding in programming can help diverge from the crowd and prove to be extremely helpful if and when the introduction of automated aircraft enters the market.</p>
<p>Of all the skills presented I would have to work on a few. Whilst my communication skills are on par with the expectations some general skills such as project and time management would have to be worked on, my skills in problem solving and arbitrary thinking would also have to be improved but this will come in time as I am exposed to some of the contexts I will be working within. As for Aerospace skills, I would need to work on all of them having only completed a High school level of each, it is a good foundation but must become more succinct if I am to succeed in my aspirations.
<i>Java developer</i>
<p>General Skills – The ability to form solutions in short time spans, as well as abstract and divergent thinking.</p>
<p>I.T Skills - Experience in Java EE, Javascript, HTML and CSS. Furthermore, knowledge in certain web services and web UI technologies.</p>
<p>Of the skills underlined in the job specifications, I would need to work on a few and maintain the rest. I have a profound tact in most of the general skills especially forming solutions. Whilst my abstract thinking is yet to be worked on it will naturally come to me in time as I get more and more experience. Of the I.T Skills, i would need to work on most - I only possess a year 12 level in web services and coding languages, but through my course at university and outside study I will achieve this goal. 
<i>IT Director</i>
<p>General Skills - Succinct skills in both the building of and maintaining of professional relationships, the ability to communicate and to lead, as well as organisational skills in particular ones revolving around resource and time management. These skills are extremely important for this occupation as it is the role of a leader, and leaders are often role models. </p>
<p>I.T Skills - A broad understanding of the I.T field in general, from all phases starting from the initial development and planning to the final execution of the project, as well as a deeper understanding of the project the team is currently working.</p>
<p> Of the skills shown above, I possess a few and need to work on the rest. Of the general skills, I believe that my ability to build and maintain relationships is developed adequately, but I will continue to improve it. Of the I.T skills shown, I would need to continue to expand my knowledge of the field so that I may have the broad understanding required for a leadership position. 
<i>Data Analyst</i>
<p>General Skills - A keen eye for detail as well as skills in maths, business, statistics and technology. A data analyst would also need to posess a knowledge in (suprisingly) analytics.</p>
<p>I.T Skills - Knowledge in computer software and tools including; scripting language, examples being Matlab and Python,  Spreadsheets and data lists, mostly found within a program such as Excel. Finally a knowledge in programming , whether it be in a language like Javascript or XML</p>
<p> Currently I have a few of the skills required under my belt, but a few I still need to progress within. As far as general skills go, I would need to improve my knowledge of analytics although skills such as an eye for detail I believe I already fulfill - in terms of this though I would need to exposed to more maths/business scenarios to increase the extent in which I can distinguish trends and stats. In terms of the I.T skills required I have a basic understanding of each - although I would need to seek out more sources and information on each in particular the scripting language.s 

<b>3.</b>
<p>After looking at the burning glass data for each of our jobs, our opinions have not changed – we are all still interested in them and if anything are glad for this data as it will guide us down that path and allow us to hone the specific skills that employers are looking for. If anything it has changed our opinion for the better as we now have a objectives set for the path towards our goal, and like many know its hard to hit a target if you cant see it. With the skills Burning Glass provides it is easy to see the objectives that will help in the grand scheme of things and will give us a greater chance at achieving our ideal place in employment.</p>   

IT Work

Interviewed Helen Niedzwiecki- Data analyst/information management officer working for the Commonwealth government (ATO)

1.	What kind of work is done by the IT professional?  
Helen replied 

 “I work in Information Management; I am currently working on our Business Glossary, an enterprise wide product available to everyone in the organization. It houses our business terms and definitions, as well as acronyms – it is the single source of truth. My role is the review the terms by engaging Subject Matter Experts to provide assurance our information is correct. Also, I am learning SharePoint because our department will be installing Office 365 and the new SharePoint over the next few months, and my team will be providing user support, that is from the point of view of Information Management, ensuring good meta data principles are adopted, record keeping principles are followed, and good site design layouts are set up.”

She also added

“I volunteered to support my team in a card sort exercise. I needed to travel to other offices to organize call centre staff into groups to sort 200 cards, these cards represented procedures the team used daily. The card sort revealed groupings to be used in a new IT reference product that is being designed.
I frequently attend training session to keep up to date.
         I am the first aid office for my floor”



2.	What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT  professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public? 
 She replied


“my team, i.e. my colleagues, I wok in a team and it is important we work well together
other IT teams, my team interacts daily with other teams
IT management, i.e. my manager, she gives guidance and set priorities
Users, it is important the products we design met the expectations of our customers
Subject Matter Experts, I liaise with several people who are experts in their field to gain knowledge”

In regard to IT professionals she added
“My team interacts with a number of IT professionals, including the IT Service Desk, where we report faults with our equipment. Also, technical areas because are in the process of updating our Business Glossary, we need to verify the process for the install and on-going maintenance”


3.	Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?  
She replied
“My current work is reviewing terms for the Business Glossary, this is taking up most of my time, there are over 90 sub-categories, I need to contact over 90 Subject Matter Experts, quality assess the terms, ingest and publish the terms.”


4.	What aspect of their position is most challenging?  
She replied
“Communication, communication – when dealing with people it is easy to mis-interpret instructions, especially when IT technical staff need to liaise with users, it is easy for instructions to be mis-understood. My team acts as a go-between for different group within our organization, therefore promoting good information management practices”



<b>IT Technologies</b>

<i>Jesse Mesiti</i>

Robots – Robots, in the broadest sense is the term coined to any man-made device that is capable of performing a task (or tasks) semi autonomously. The word robot is derived from the Czech term ‘Robota’ meaning ‘forced work or labour’ and in essence is a direct indication on a robot’s purpose. Whether they are programmed to act autonomously or controlled remotely, robots exist for the sole reason of performing tasks that would otherwise be tedious, dangerous or difficult for a human to. Robots are usually associated with a robotic human-esque machine, but they are everything from this (the pinnacle of the technology) to a small invention in the shape of a box (the humble beginning). This humble beginning was in the Unimate, the first programmable robot. It was installed to work in a factory in 1961 and its purpose was to move hot pieces of metal, which was normally a dangerous task for a human to be doing. 

The prospect of robots exploded shortly after this invention, a mere 5 years later in 1966 Shakey the robot was created. Shakey the Robot was different to all others who shared the robot term for a variety of reasons, other robots up to Shakey would have to be instructed on each individual step whereas Shakey could analyze commands and break them down into individual commands itself. Shakey was a stack of gear containing drive wheels on the bottom, a push bar and cats whiskers bump sensors (an image shown below). Through this gear the robot was able to be given general instructions, such as "move the block onto the table" and once it had received the instructions Shakey would reason how to carry out and complete the task. In the case of the move block instruction, Shakey would quite possibly look around the room, identify the block and then the table, and assess how to get the block onto the table, including navigating around any obstacles in the room that would prevent it from doing so. 

Robots have, however come a long way since Shakey. In existence today there are various robots that exhibit the surreal power that this technology possesses, a few of these are Asimo, Petma and Actroid-Sit. Asimo is a robot designed by Honda that can walk and run like a human would, whilst also being capable of performing basic tasks like holding a platter and serving food. Petman is a robot designed to test clothing that protects against hazardous chemicals, the robot tests this by balancing, walking and generally doing a great range of human-esque movements all whilst being exposed to the aforementioned chemicals. Finally, Actroid-Sit is a rather unnerving humanoid looking robot that functions autonomously, talking and interacting with people. It features the ability to maintain eye contact and gesture with and to the person it is currently interacting with. Actroid-Sit can also comprehend sign language and when interrupted will stop and respond to the new interaction. 

Robots in this current day are used for a variety of reasons, the main two being both robots used to stretch the boundaries in our knowledge of artificial intelligence, henceforth coined as research robots and robots used within companies and corporations to carry out mundane and one dimensional jobs, henceforth coined industry robots. Industry robots are generally large and unlike the research counterparts do not resemble their human creators, they are generally a single segment like an arm or hammer that is programmed to do a single task, or multiple smaller ones. These tasks can be things such as spray painting a panel of a car on a conveyor belt. Industry robots are used to increase the output and efficiency of the company they are implemented within, and whilst we might see changes in their integration and implementation they are complete for the most part. Research robots on the other hand are still at the summit of their development. Research robots are ones such as Actroid and Asimo, in which they are complex, human-like machines that are programmed to carry out a variety of different tasks and interact in ways that seem sci-fi like. These interactions are things like the eye contact and sign language seen in Actroid and the running seen in Asimo. Unlike the industry robots, research robots will see rapid changes and improvements in the next few years. People working within artificial intelligence will continue to push the borders of robotics until they believe they have reached the pinnacle, but as many would tell you – robotics is an ever changing field where the possibilities are nigh on endless, as such as technology continues to grow and improve so will knowledge and application. 

Although robotic technology is especially impressive in this day and time, we can only expect it to keep growing and become even more impressive as the years pass and technology becomes more acute. Sooner or later the more monotonous tasks of every day life will be passed onto an a.i or robot to manage and administrate, much like the technology that already exists in programs like Cortana and Siri, as such the impact of robots on modern life will be drastic, like many things the introduction of automated machinery will have both positive and negative implications on the everyday life of humans. Some tasks will become more efficient, and some tasks will have their human workers replaced with a robot counterpart. This has already become a reality in many of the larger corporations where robots are implemented into the manufacturing process to increase output, whilst this hasn’t had too much of an implication on the labour force with the widespread use of automation and this technology becoming more accessible some time in the near future even smaller corporations will begin to implement robots within their manufacturing process. This is where a drastic reduction in the labour force will be seen. 

While without a doubt robots threaten human employment in mundane labour tasks there are some things that will never be within risk of replacement. A big factor of robots is that they lack emotions - human emotions such as empathy, personality, touch and communication are vital parts of many jobs and without them they job itself is nothing, especially for some smaller businesses where they will survive off of the development of long term relationships and interactions with customers. There is also things like cost and resources that come into play when thinking of these sort of things. So whilst robots seem to be a more efficient and effective way of doing things, in some scenarios they are nothing less than impractical. 

In everyday life robots will change a variety of things, but oppositely some things will remain the same. As I am headed (hopefully) for an occupation in engineering, robots will affect the way that my job is administered and carried out. Many tasks will be owed to the use of robots, whether they be for calculations or demonstrations and as time progresses more and more tasks will be able to be administered and handled out by an artificial intelligence, so in the work mind frame robots will change daily life although the limitations outlined in the paragraph above would still apply. This would be a given for friends and family working in all other manufacturing and development fields of work as well. Within leisure time, robots will also have some implications, we can already see this in programs such as Cortana and Siri. When this technology becomes more accessible and widespread and further coupled with ever-growing artificial intelligence technology it will soon make its way into more everyday aspects of life (aside from computers and phones as Cortana and Siri are). These everyday aspects would be seen in trivial yet essential tasks like turning the lights on and off via voice, or turning on the oven. Something similar to just this can be seen in Alexa (a voice activated/controlled robot that plays music, makes reminders ect.) which proves that the technology is slowly making its way into the everyday lives of people all around the world. In saying this, the way we live our everyday lives will be changed and shaped by the prowess of the artificial intelligence we currently have access to. All these daily tasks will be inextricably linked with robots, just like it was with electricity a few centuries ago.

<i>Matthew Scully (Natural language processing and chatterbots)</i>

Natural Language Processing is defined as the ability of a machine to analyse and understand and even generate human speech. Natural language processing aims to achieve a link between humans and robots similar to a link between humans and humans. The interactions are supposed to feel natural like talking in plain English which is a new concept which is going to and currently powering some of the latest cutting-edge technologies, for example, devices such as Google Home or Amazon’s Echo. Programs usually communicate using various programming languages such as C++ or C# or Java. However, there is barrier between artificial languages and natural languages that has not until recently been solved. Now with these devices, the program is able to understand and process human language and even respond via generating a natural language response. Other programs that use natural language processing are things like auto correct / spell check which has been around for some time but acts as error prevention for users. As well as this, a lot of companies help centres are moving away from just using either call centres or online human support tickets. Rather, most websites now try to first resolve any query with a help bot to resolve smaller and easier to fix issues to avoid cluttering the support centres with these problems. These current / past uses of natural language processing and chatterbots allow for a system to be much more efficient than the previous use of human interaction or human input. This indicates that over the next few years we will continue to see a rise in the use of natural language processing to speed up and to make processes easier such as voice commanded self-driving however this will probably take more than a few years to accomplish. What I learned from listening to a podcast featuring IT professional Vlad Sejnoha, the CTO of Nuance Communications (an organisation covering AI and natural language processing solutions) is that natural language processing “allows us to control increasingly sophisticated systems and machines and applications.” Not only does this highlight how natural language processing will help less experienced users to control higher complexity programs, but how this idea of controlling these machines will be made a lot easier for all users no matter their experience level. Another ability Vlad mentions is relevant to healthcare and how natural language processing can be used to understand medical reports or even conversations between patients and doctors to further assist medical professionals with the accuracy of reports and even have the potential to fully automate the system entirely meaning it can save a lot of resources while performing the task the same way if not better. 

The likely impact that this technology will have is it a lot of human interaction with computers is becoming “hands free.” Features such as spam filters that have been implemented to read and process natural language to determine if the meaning of the email is spam or actually relevant. Another popular example of this technology are the Google Home and Amazon Echo type devices that are able to answer questions via verbal input meaning that users can interact with a program without having to put any physical input in. The hands-free interaction and interaction with programs rather than humans offers efficiency and saving of resources, however, this can also lead to the eventual redundancy of human support workers or even the keyboard itself if you look far enough into the future. An increase in security is likely to happen over the next five to ten years with the ability for human verification software. As Vlad touched on in the podcast (Madvan, 2018), what is being worked on is for programs to be able to not only process natural language but differentiate from one person to another. This opens up a whole list of possibilities, but the first one that comes to mind is security. Being able to unlock your door with a voice password (along with facial recognition software) will decrease the chance of fraud. Another idea that springs from differentiating human voices is in a household scenario, for a program that will likely be able to control most aspects of your home, also be able to make a personal profile of you to be able to know when you are sad, happy or if your voice commanding the house AI to do something has the permission to tell it to do that. These possibilities mean that most human interaction with machines such as dishwashers and televisions, will no longer require direct physical input, rather just replaced with a language processer which can translate messages into functions for other machines. 

Personally, I think this will affect my day to day life by a great deal. Having these devices around the home in the future, with the assumed capability of being able to control temperature, lights, household machines, etc. I also believe that this technology will allow for everyday people with little to no experience, be able to efficiently control highly complex machines. This may not apply directly to me as I wouldn’t say that I have little to no experience when it comes to using programs however for family and friends, this may bridge the gap between impossibly sophisticated machinery and a casual user wanting to perform a function without needing to write code. I am looking forward to this being integrated more into our society because I think it can offer good things for the world such as my healthcare example above. Not only will this improve the efficiency of day to day tasks, but it can and will improve the accuracy of important information. I also think that some of the things I found out about this technology and some of the capabilities of these language processers over the next decade or so sound invasive and creepy. However, the overarching theme is that this technology will provide greater freedom to me to be able to remotely control devices quite easily. Luckily, with my bachelor being in computer science, my job will hopefully not be made redundant in my lifetime meaning I will be able to build up my career over the years without the threat of my job security. 	

<p>Autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>Cheng Lin BAI</p>

Autonomous vehicles

An autonomous car is a vehicle that able to navigate itself through conductions that is without the human. It really has the potential to change everything and yet has become a concrete reality for this type of vehicle, and it may be possible that it will lay the foundation for the future vehicle technology that the Computers will be the domain in the states of driving. 
2016 is the booming year of self-driving technologies, and it started the new era of the self-driving cars, by using laser radar, ultrasonic sensor, camera, GPU all coded and assembled to the vehicles to help with navigation, they implement part of Autonomous vehicles capability. Currently, Autonomous vehicles technology is still at the laboratory stage; universities, full-fledged software companies or automobile manufacturers are mainly conducting those development activities. 

Nowadays, there are two sets of standards for the classification of intelligent cars. The first made by the U.S. Department of transportation's NHSTA (national highway safety administration); The second standard made by SAE International, the International Association of automobile engineers.
The standards of both agencies divided into L0~L5, where L0 refers to manual driving. It is important to note that NHTSA has already adopted SAE International's classification standards as early as September 2016.

Thus, SAE International's standards are much clear. They stipulate that:

Level		Steering & deceleration control	Observe the environment	Responses for Intense driving	Response conditions
L0	No automation
	Driver	Driver	Driver	_
L1	Driver assistance
	Driver + System	Driver	Driver	Part
L2	Partial assistance
	System	Driver	Driver	Part
L3	Conditional assistance
	System	System	Driver	Part
L4	High automation
	System	System	System	Part
L5	Full automation
	System	System	System	Fully
(Mraz, 2017)

There are those companies who try to make vehicles fully autonomous, such as ford, Audi, Mercedes, Google. Also, there have manufactures that do the automatic auxiliary driving, like Volvo, Tesla, etc.,
For example, "Tesla" - the world leading self-driving electric vehicles manufacturer, their vehicles can be assessable by using GPS sensing knowledge to help with navigation, visual sensors through multiple active cameras around those vehicles and laser radar to avoid collisions, and they have reach the L2+ level of the autonomous vehicles.
There is a research report by the consulting firm PwC which projected that by 2030 self-driving cars on a ride-sharing platform like Uber or Didi could reduce by 90% the total number of cars on the road now. The basic equation on this is if the current vehicle usage is that they are now driven only 10% of the time and parked 90% of the time, then if that reversed, it would reduce the number of cars on the road by 90%. The research does not imply this is what will happen precisely in the future, but that is the direction things are going.

we are starting our new era that the man-driven vehicles may well at the situation that humanity first on a large scale that uses automobiles that end the uses of horses.
 



There will be two sides impact of this development is that current major mass transportation projects like rail, etcetera, may now be unnecessary if 90% of cars and traffic go away as PwC predicts. Of course, many things would change, and the impact would be huge on energy need, jobs, urban planning, workplace design, pollution. On the other hand, as all the vehicles will undoubtedly be autonomous so there will be no needed for parking, the cost of insurance will be much cheaper and more creative ways to use vehicles.
First of all, The parking lots. How dark is the parking lot industry? In the United States alone, more than 10,000 square kilometres of land used for parking. Washington DC citizen spent more than $90 million in parking lots every year! Moreover, if there is a self-driving car, people will never have to pay ten or even 20 dollars for parking every hour. Research shows that autonomous driving saves at least 40 percent of parking space. Technology companies are also developing cars with free parking. When the owner gets off the bus, the car will look for a parking space. When the car owner needs to return, the car will open ahead of time. It will save people time to finding a parking spot. Secondly, their insurance. Ninety percent of all traffic accidents are human-made. If there is no traffic accident, there will be no injuries, what can insurance companies eat? Perhaps these companies could consider how to ensure humanoid robots, such as how to compensate for faulty machines and how to handle disputes between autonomous vehicles.

Below: comparison of the cost of driving and driving insurance. In either model, self-driving will be many times cheaper. 

Moreover, Autonomous vehicles will have the impact on the traffic on the way of our trip. The popularity of driverless cars can help people solve these problems to a large extent. When people get tired, they can put the vehicles into autonomous mode. Thus, people get adequate rest. At the same time, people will start to realize that they do not have to waste the extra time and money on the tickets for planes or trains. Autonomous vehicles will have the impact on the traffic on the way of our trip.

Personally, first of all, it is impossible to deny that unmanned driving has a significant impact on the way we travel and the way we travel. So, what are the specific aspects of these impacts? In contrast, the present, for long distance travelling the primary way of our trip is by plane or train, but we often will miss the beautiful views on the trip. So, what about driving? We can drive our vehicles to stop at anywhere and anytime to enjoy and catch the beauty of the trip, but Long hour driving could become exhaustion and dangerous, thus if we have no worries if we can get our autonomous vehicles on the road.
From another perspective, because of the self-driving technology, so we do not have to worry about how long we will reach the destination. We can chill in the car, play games, which makes the family trip more interesting, there will be no drive needed so everyone can involve in the family entertainment. Let the way we travel from the destination travel into a more comfortable, enjoyable, and made our travel more "detailed".

<b>Feedback</b>
<p>Our team worked well together despite the occasional problems that occurred along the way. These were namely sickness and a group member not contributing or showing up to class. These were both rectified quickly however and despite these problems occurring we continued to work on our predetermined parts independantly so that neither problem effected our project too much. The work was spread out between each member as equally as possible, with members helping each other once their own parts had been completed. Each member was also responsive to messages and criteria and took on requests and criticism in an open and acknowledgeable way. Although we only met once as a full group in class which was where most of the work was set out and planned, we were also communicative on the online platform, in particular canvas group announcements. The ability for our group to bounce from the problems we occurred was definitely an aspect that we did well, an improvement could have been doing it a little earlier however. I have learnt that when working in groups, everyone must be on the same page – everyone must want to be there and must want to do the work, when this is the case everyone is more receptive to information and criteria and are more likely to give their own in return.

Our group worked together well in the end as we pulled ourselves together to become organised and lay out all the tasks and delegate which tasks were to be done by who. Each person committed their work sufficiently to the GitHub. Communication was definitely lacking in our group. Apart from the few times we met in person, the discussions / announcements page was pretty dry with no one really telling the others what / when they were going to do things. What was surprising was the fact that we managed to actually complete the project after such a rough start of having multiple team members be absent over the few weeks period. I was surprised to see that my team members remained calm under this pressure because I was stressing on the inside, thankfully their more relaxed attitude helped keep me positive about getting the enormous amount of work done in time. I think I learned a lot of trust while working in this group. My trust was tested, putting tasks into other people’s hands and praying they would complete them to a satisfactory level was something I had to do. I trusted my group members that they would also get the work done by the deadline. The GitHub log of activity reflects the work done on the assignment by a good margin, however just because other people may have done more commits, doesn’t necessarily mean that they completed more work than another person. I think if the commits were to be compared an even balance of work would have been completed by all participating team members.</p>
