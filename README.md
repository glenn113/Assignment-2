<b><i>Personal Information</i></b>

Jesse Mesiti, s3728420. Has a background in maths and science, as well as sport and i.t. All of these are from leisure time activities and subjects studied in school. Hobbies varied including anything from health and fitness (gym), to sports (mostly soccer and football) and to computers. Interest in I.T is aimed towards robots and computers once again, in how they work and how they are put together. I.T experience is found exclusively in years studying the subject, and leisure time activities - in this case it was the building of a computer in 2015, except for that not much however.

<i>Matthew Scully (s3722193)</i>

Unlike many other people I have come across, my cultural background is somewhat... vanilla. Both my parents and grandparents, even my great-grandparents were all born and raised in Australia. As far as I know, I have loose ancestral connections to some European countries. These include Sweden, Ireland, England and possibly others which apparently my great, great, great, great...? grandparents came from. I found this quite interesting and surprising when I found out this information because I didn't know of my background up until learning this. A major hobby I enjoy in my spare time is PC computer gaming. I have had some overly fun experiences while playing vast genres of online multiplayer games with friends. I have grown up with PC games since my pre-teens and used it as a great way to cure my boredom. My education to date is I have completed up to Year 12. The high school I went to was Westbourne Grammar School located out Hoppers Crossing way.

<p>The above personality test identified myself as a visual learner, a learner that does just this best when reading or seeing pictures. It is much easier for someone such as myself to understand and remember things by sight. I can picture what I am  learning in your head, and learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning and when reciting information will often use these visuals to help.

Visual learners are usually neat and clean, although often may have difficulty with spoken directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. Visual learners in generally are attracted to color and spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery both metaphorically and literally.</p>

<p>The 16 personalities quiz indentified me with the debater personality type. A debater engages in (mostly) formal discussion on a particular matter , in which opposing arguments are put forward. Debaters generally enjoy being correct and disproving their oppositions arguments or opinions, they don’t do this because they are trying to achieve some deeper purpose or strategic goal, but for the simple reason that it’s fun (and often ego enducing). No one loves the process of mental sparring more than debaters, as it gives them a chance to exercise their effortlessly quick wit, broad accumulated knowledge base, and capacity for connecting disparate ideas to prove their points.
	
The main goal of the debater personality type is to gain knowledge, and there is no better way to do this then analysing arguments both your own and someone elses.

<b>Myer Briggs Test</b>

According to the Myer Briggs Test, I have the personality of a "Protagonist." The results describe me as a natural born leader, full of passion and charisma. Only around 2% of the population fall under this category and turn out to be characters like politicians, teachers and coaches.

<b>My Learning Style</b>

Auditory: 45% Visual: 35% Tactile: 20%
According to the learning style test, I am mainly an auditory learner, meaning I learn by hearing/listening. I store information by the way it sounds and I remember things by the way I heard them. I have an easier time understanding spoken instructions rather than written ones.

<b>The Big Five Personality Test</b>

This test has five major categories.
For "Openness" I scored 69% (high range) which tends to mean I am creative, adventurous and intellectual.
For "Conscientiousness" I scored 42% (low range) which tends to mean I am impulsive and easily side-tracked.
For "Extraversion" I scored 85% (high range) which tends to mean I am friendly and outgoing.
For "Agreeableness" I scored 62.5% (moderate range) which tends to mean I balance the interests of myself and others similarly.
For "Neuroticism" I scored 42% (low range) which tends to mean I am less likely to experience negative emotions and I am more optimistic and carefree.

<p>After looking at the burning glass data for each of our jobs, our opinions have not changed – we are all still interested in them and if anything are glad for this data as it will guide us down that path and allow us to hone the specific skills that employers are looking for. If anything it has changed our opinion for the better as we now have a objectives set for the path towards our goal, and like many know its hard to hit a target if you cant see it. With the skills Burning Glass provides it is easy to see the objectives that will help in the grand scheme of things and will give us a greater chance at achieving our ideal place in employment.</p>

<i>Jesse Mesiti</i>

Robots – Robots, in the broadest sense is the term coined to any man-made device that is capable of performing a task (or tasks) semi autonomously. The word robot is derived from the Czech term ‘Robota’ meaning ‘forced work or labour’ and in essence is a direct indication on a robot’s purpose. Whether they are programmed to act autonomously or controlled remotely, robots exist for the sole reason of performing tasks that would otherwise be tedious, dangerous or difficult for a human to. Robots are usually associated with a robotic human-esque machine, but they are everything from this (the pinnacle of the technology) to a small invention in the shape of a box (the humble beginning). This humble beginning was in the Unimate, the first programmable robot. It was installed to work in a factory in 1961 and its purpose was to move hot pieces of metal, which was normally a dangerous task for a human to be doing. 

The prospect of robots exploded shortly after this invention, a mere 5 years later in 1966 Shakey the robot was created. Shakey the Robot was different to all others who shared the robot term for a variety of reasons, other robots up to Shakey would have to be instructed on each individual step whereas Shakey could analyze commands and break them down into individual commands itself. Shakey was a stack of gear containing drive wheels on the bottom, a push bar and cats whiskers bump sensors (an image shown below). Through this gear the robot was able to be given general instructions, such as "move the block onto the table" and once it had received the instructions Shakey would reason how to carry out and complete the task. In the case of the move block instruction, Shakey would quite possibly look around the room, identify the block and then the table, and assess how to get the block onto the table, including navigating around any obstacles in the room that would prevent it from doing so.

Robots have, however come a long way since Shakey. In existence today there are various robots that exhibit the surreal power that this technology possesses, a few of these are Asimo, Petma and Actroid-Sit. Asimo is a robot designed by Honda that can walk and run like a human would, whilst also being capable of performing basic tasks like holding a platter and serving food. Petman is a robot designed to test clothing that protects against hazardous chemicals, the robot tests this by balancing, walking and generally doing a great range of human-esque movements all whilst being exposed to the aforementioned chemicals. Finally, Actroid-Sit is a rather unnerving humanoid looking robot that functions autonomously, talking and interacting with people. It features the ability to maintain eye contact and gesture with and to the person it is currently interacting with. Actroid-Sit can also comprehend sign language and when interrupted will stop and respond to the new interaction. 

Robots in this current day are used for a variety of reasons, the main two being both robots used to stretch the boundaries in our knowledge of artificial intelligence, henceforth coined as research robots and robots used within companies and corporations to carry out mundane and one dimensional jobs, henceforth coined industry robots. Industry robots are generally large and unlike the research counterparts do not resemble their human creators, they are generally a single segment like an arm or hammer that is programmed to do a single task, or multiple smaller ones. These tasks can be things such as spray painting a panel of a car on a conveyor belt. Industry robots are used to increase the output and efficiency of the company they are implemented within, and whilst we might see changes in their integration and implementation they are complete for the most part. Research robots on the other hand are still at the summit of their development. Research robots are ones such as Actroid and Asimo, in which they are complex, human-like machines that are programmed to carry out a variety of different tasks and interact in ways that seem sci-fi like. These interactions are things like the eye contact and sign language seen in Actroid and the running seen in Asimo. Unlike the industry robots, research robots will see rapid changes and improvements in the next few years. People working within artificial intelligence will continue to push the borders of robotics until they believe they have reached the pinnacle, but as many would tell you – robotics is an ever changing field where the possibilities are nigh on endless, as such as technology continues to grow and improve so will knowledge and application. 

Although robotic technology is especially impressive in this day and time, we can only expect it to keep growing and become even more impressive as the years pass and technology becomes more acute. Sooner or later the more monotonous tasks of every day life will be passed onto an a.i or robot to manage and administrate, much like the technology that already exists in programs like Cortana and Siri, as such the impact of robots on modern life will be drastic, like many things the introduction of automated machinery will have both positive and negative implications on the everyday life of humans. Some tasks will become more efficient, and some tasks will have their human workers replaced with a robot counterpart. This has already become a reality in many of the larger corporations where robots are implemented into the manufacturing process to increase output, whilst this hasn’t had too much of an implication on the labour force with the widespread use of automation and this technology becoming more accessible some time in the near future even smaller corporations will begin to implement robots within their manufacturing process. This is where a drastic reduction in the labour force will be seen. 

While without a doubt robots threaten human employment in mundane labour tasks there are some things that will never be within risk of replacement. A big factor of robots is that they lack emotions - human emotions such as empathy, personality, touch and communication are vital parts of many jobs and without them they job itself is nothing, especially for some smaller businesses where they will survive off of the development of long term relationships and interactions with customers. There is also things like cost and resources that come into play when thinking of these sort of things. So whilst robots seem to be a more efficient and effective way of doing things, in some scenarios they are nothing less than impractical. 

In everyday life robots will change a variety of things, but oppositely some things will remain the same. As I am headed (hopefully) for an occupation in engineering, robots will affect the way that my job is administered and carried out. Many tasks will be owed to the use of robots, whether they be for calculations or demonstrations and as time progresses more and more tasks will be able to be administered and handled out by an artificial intelligence, so in the work mind frame robots will change daily life although the limitations outlined in the paragraph above would still apply. This would be a given for friends and family working in all other manufacturing and development fields of work as well. Within leisure time, robots will also have some implications, we can already see this in programs such as Cortana and Siri. When this technology becomes more accessible and widespread and further coupled with ever-growing artificial intelligence technology it will soon make its way into more everyday aspects of life (aside from computers and phones as Cortana and Siri are). These everyday aspects would be seen in trivial yet essential tasks like turning the lights on and off via voice, or turning on the oven. Something similar to just this can be seen in Alexa (a voice activated/controlled robot that plays music, makes reminders ect.) which proves that the technology is slowly making its way into the everyday lives of people all around the world. In saying this, the way we live our everyday lives will be changed and shaped by the prowess of the artificial intelligence we currently have access to. All these daily tasks will be inextricably linked with robots, just like it was with electricity a few centuries ago. 

<i>Matthew Scully (Natural language processing and chatterbots)</i>

Natural Language Processing is defined as the ability of a machine to analyse and understand and even generate human speech. Natural language processing aims to achieve a link between humans and robots similar to a link between humans and humans. The interactions are supposed to feel natural like talking in plain English which is a new concept which is going to and currently powering some of the latest cutting-edge technologies, for example, devices such as Google Home or Amazon’s Echo. Programs usually communicate using various programming languages such as C++ or C# or Java. However, there is barrier between artificial languages and natural languages that has not until recently been solved. Now with these devices, the program is able to understand and process human language and even respond via generating a natural language response.

The likely impact and the impact that this technology is having is it 

<p>Autonomous vehicles</p>
<p>Cheng Lin BAI</p>

An autonomous car is a vehicle that able to navigate itself through conductions that is without the human. It has become a concrete reality for this type of vehicle, and it may be possible that it will lay the foundation for the future vehicle technology that the Computers will be the domain in the states of driving. 
2016 is the booming year of self-driving technologies, and it started the new era of the self-driving cars, by using laser radar, ultrasonic sensor, camera, GPU all coded and assembled to the vehicles to help with navigation, they implement part of Autonomous vehicles capability. Currently, Autonomous vehicles technology is still at the laboratory stage; universities, full-fledged software companies or automobile manufacturers are mainly conducting those development activities.
Nowadays, there are two sets of standards for the classification of intelligent cars. The first made by the U.S. Department of transportation's NHSTA (national highway safety administration); The second standard made by SAE International, the International Association of automobile engineers.
The standards of both agencies divided into L0~L5, where L0 refers to manual driving. It is important to note that NHTSA has already adopted SAE International's classification standards as early as September 2016.
Thus, SAE International's standards are much clear. They stipulate that:
Level		Steering & deceleration control	Observe the environment	Responses for Intense driving	Response conditions
L0	No automation
	Driver	Driver	Driver	_
L1	Driver assistance
	Driver + System	Driver	Driver	Part
L2	Partial assistance
	System	Driver	Driver	Part
L3	Conditional assistance
	System	System	Driver	Part
L4	High automation
	System	System	System	Part
L5	Full automation
	System	System	System	Fully
(Mraz, 2017)

For example, "Tesla" - the world leading self-driving electric vehicles manufacturer, their vehicles can be assessable by using GPS sensing knowledge to help with navigation, visual sensors through multiple active cameras around those vehicles and laser radar to avoid collisions, and they have reach the L2 level of the autonomous vehicles.
